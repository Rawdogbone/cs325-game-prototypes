- 
The goal of this game is to make the randomly 
generated sandwich you see at the top of the screen.
You will do this by solving math problems, fun right?
For example, for the first phase, you need a piece of bread,
click the answer to the math equation and when that answer is 
corresponding to bread, you will get a 'yay'. This will proceed 
you to the next phase of making the sandwich.

NOTE: the teapot to the left will be spewing out 'steam' towards
the pirate bay ship, because steam fights piracy. The steam
will spew faster as you progress. Click the steam to make
it disappear and keep the ships health above 0. If you manage 
this and finish building your snadwich, you will win.
Otherwise, you suck...

Controls: the mouse
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
- Keeping the mouse near the teapot, wait for a spew, then click to remove and then focus on problem.
</li>

A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
- You are a piracy advocate and are hungry. Stop the greed Steam capitalists from ripping you off for games and defend for what you believe in!!! Also make a sandwich.
