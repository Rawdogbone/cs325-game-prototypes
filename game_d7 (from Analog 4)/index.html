<h2>iSpy the Differences!</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
- This game pays homage to the old iSpy books. I combined this mechanic with the spot the difference in two sets and involved animations.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
- This game has tons of themes and tons of assets alongside. I wanted each level to take you into a new 'realm' of sorts.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
- Learned how to improve the workflow of developing games.
- Easiest: Animating and mapping.
- Hardest: Art and design as there is so much in this small game.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>- This game is inspired by the iSpy books.</a></li>
<li>- From the phyisical I learned that the smallest change in a game can make a big difference in the way you enjoy both good and bad.</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
- Find the differences between two set pieces.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
- iSpy, 'spot the difference'
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
- Mouse movement. Click based.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
- Set pieces and variety amongst graphics.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
- Serenity and nostalgia.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
- 
Click on whatever level you want to play and then look for differences between the two sets. These differences could be anything like a different movement pattern, or that one image might be on one set and not the other. When you see a difference, click on the difference. Once you see all the differences indicated by a count meter at the bottom, you win that level :) NOTE: Since this is like pre-alpha, there are seven levels but they are all basically the same in regards to their differences.

</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
- None. Enjoy the sets.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
- Youre a kid again, have fun my dude.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
- 12-90+
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
- 2-3 minutes per level.
