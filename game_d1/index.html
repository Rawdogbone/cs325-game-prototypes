Uses a custom sprite that has bouncy effects and acceleration towards the cursor.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype? -How to use a very basic Phaser setup.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it? -Easiest: Using custom .png's. Hardest: Looking for good content.
